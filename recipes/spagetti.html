    <h2>What's Somalian Spagetti All About?</h2>

    <p>Somali Spaghetti and Sauce, or baasto iyo suugo, is a popular dish blending Italian and Somali flavors. It features spaghetti topped with a spiced meat sauce made from minced beef or lamb, tomatoes, onions, garlic, and the aromatic Somali spice mix called "xawaash".</p>

    <h2>Procedures And Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <em>
        <li>Place cilantro and garlic in the bowl of a food processor; pulse until finely chopped.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Toast cumin seeds in a small pot over low heat until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Cool, 5 minutes. Grind into a powder using a spice grinder or a mortal and pestle.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Transfer ground cumin to a small bowl. Add Himalayan pink salt, turmeric, paprika, Italian seasoning, seasoning blend, and black pepper; set spice mixture aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add ground beef; cook and stir until browned, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 spice mixture. Add onion; cook and stir until softened, about 5 minutes. Add carrots and potato; cook, covered, stirring occasionally, until slightly softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Stir in tomatoes; bring sauce to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low; stir in cilantro-garlic mixture and remaining 1/2 spice mixture. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until flavors combine, 30 to 40 minutes. Thin sauce with water if it seems too thick.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain. Serve sauce over pasta.</li>
